# Manifestation-of-Chaos-LSTM

## Project 
Study the effects of chaos in a custom LSTM architecture  
We will use chaotic maps to initialise our parameters and study the change in performance of our custom LSTM on stock price prediction.

## Duration
The project is for 1 semester.
This is a research project, and can continue as long as you're willing to work.  

## Details
>**Domain** - Deep Learning, Chaos theory  
**Prerequisite** - Deep learning, basic machine learning concepts  
Understanding of Chaos theory is not required but you will have to learn basic concepts while working.  
**Skills** - Python

Basic knowledge about PyTorch
**Goal** - Improve the performance of custom LSTM using chaotic initializations.

**Current Status** - The custom LSTM architecture is completed and has been tested for blood glucose prediction.

**Expectations** - Create a stock price dataset and modify the current LSTM to work on this new data. Also implement chaotic initialization in the LSTM architeccture.
